This script is adapted from an Uchicago econometrics course, rewritten in a pedagogical format for easy replication and learning of basic models. 

It covers three standard tasks:
(Section 1) Binary outcome: Linear Probability Model (LPM) vs Probit
(Section 2) Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
(Section 3) Two-way Fixed Effects (firm & year)

How to use?
1) Adjust the working directory.
2) Ensure data files are present in your computer:
- smoking.dta  
 - jtrain.dta  
The DiD section uses organ_donations from the 'causaldata' package.
3) Run in RStudio. Output is printed to the console.

I will gladly accept feedback on isabellapestana@uchicago.edu or isabella.nascimento@fgv.br, if any.
